copy the img the course staff gave us. 

1: 
from your Intermediate VM run - 

 qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 4096m \
  -nographic \
  -cpu host \
  -accel kvm \
  -nic user,model=virtio-net-pci,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -drive file=jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk-kvm.img,format=qcow2

*that defines a port between the qemu and our vm. 
*enter user name and password. 

2: 
on the qemu - 

sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh

 *check if worked form the Intermediate VM 

ssh root@localhost -p 2222

*should connect again to the qemu

3: 
on the vs code: 
open the emote ssh configuration and add the qemu as host - 

Host qemu-vm
    HostName localhost
    User root
    Port 2222
    ProxyJump (your.user.name)@(Intermediate.VM.ip)

4: 
on your local host terminal gen a new ssh key - 

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "qemu-access"

*copy the key to use it in the following step.

5:
on the qemu: 

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

*paste your key and exit the file. 

 chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

6: we are ready to go - try to use the ssh connection via vscode to connect the qemu directly.
