 Section 1: JSON_DUMPS
=============================

- I am working with the `json_dumps_bench` benchmark as part of my project. 
  I would like guidance on how to build the work process step by step, starting 
  from the baseline and progressing towards optimized implementations.

- After establishing the baseline and identifying bottlenecks through profiling, 
  I would like to explore possible directions for optimization, including both 
  custom improvements and the use of alternative libraries such as `orjson`.

- Please provide a more detailed explanation of the profiling results obtained 
  with `perf` and FlameGraph, focusing on the major hotspots and their impact 
  on performance.

- How can the `json_dumps` benchmark be analyzed without manually downloading 
  and installing all components on the machine?

- Could you suggest possible optimization strategies that are realistic within 
  the Python ecosystem?

- I would like to iteratively improve the optimized implementation until we 
  achieve at least a 5% performance improvement compared to the baseline.

 Section 2: LOGGING
=============================

- I am examining a customized logging implementation (`my_logging.py`).  
  I would like clarification on how the script verifies that outputs are 
  consistent between the standard logging module and the customized version.

- Please summarize the exact modifications applied to `my_logging.py` compared 
  to the standard logging implementation, with a focus on design choices 
  and performance implications.

- I would like to refine the interpretation of the performance results:  
  ▪ Average runtime was reduced significantly (e.g., from 3.212 to 2.443).  
  ▪ The relative improvement reached ~31%.  
  ▪ Standard deviations were low, indicating stable measurements.  

- Please confirm the correct description of external tools and libraries:  
  ▪ No external Python libraries were used; the optimization was achieved by a 
    drop-in replacement (`my_logging.py`).  
  ▪ System-level tools (`perf`, `FlameGraph`) were used for profiling and 
    visualization purposes.
